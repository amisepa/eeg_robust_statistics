# Robust statistical methods for M/EEG multidimensional data

- GLM including OLS, IRLS, WLS optimization for time (ERP) and frequency (power spectra) domains. GLM deals better accounts for within-subject variance.

- nonparametric statistics, including bootstrap and permutation approaches

- robust corrections for type 1 error (maximum likelihood, spatiotemporal clustering, threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE)

- 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% Bayesian high-density intervals (HDIs)

- data visualization (mass-univariate, scalp topography, course plot)

## Comparing GLM/no-GLM results on ERP data (N = 78) 

Raw ERP (no GLM)
